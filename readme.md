## Testing

### Running tests in Docker

1. Run `npm run env start`
1. Run `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`.

### Running tests locally

1. Create a MySQL database for the tests. Don't reuse an existing database, because all of the data will be deleted every time the tests are run.
1. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`, with the values for the database you created above:
	```
	export WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wp_tests
	export WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wp_tests
	export WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=wp_tests
	```
1. `source ~/.bashrc`
1. Run `composer run test` or `composer run test:watch`.
